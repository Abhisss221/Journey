Journey: Career Guidance System

📖 Overview
Journey is an advanced career guidance platform designed to help young teens navigate the overwhelming process of choosing a career. By leveraging machine learning and ensemble learning techniques, Journey provides personalized career recommendations based on an individual's unique personality, interests, and ambitions.

In addition to career suggestions, the platform offers tailored recommendations for top colleges and universities, complete with details about their admission processes. For students inclined toward Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Journey further recommends the most suitable CSE sub-domain based on their strengths.

By aligning career choices with personal strengths and interests, Journey ensures students make informed decisions that lead to long-term professional satisfaction.
